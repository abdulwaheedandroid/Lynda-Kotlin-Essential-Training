What you should know
- [Instructor] To get the most out of this course, you should have some programming experience, preferably with a curly brace language like Java or C#, but any coding experience is helpful. This course is for beginner Kotlin programmers. It starts with the most basic concepts, and advances is to cover some more complicated things like coroutines. You will learn the language more thoroughly if you follow along, code the examples yourself and complete all of the challenges. We'll use a Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA for this course. Kotlin development is possible with most popular editors. But IntelliJ is free and includes tools to make programming delightful. You should also be comfortable installing applications on your development system. And most of all, you should be ready to learn a new language. Hopefully by the end of this course you'll understand why I think Kotlin is so awesome.
