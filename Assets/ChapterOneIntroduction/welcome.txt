Welcome
- [Troy] Back in 2010, JetBrains, a developer of programming tools, had a problem. Adding features to their products, including the award winning IntelliJ IDEA, was growing increasingly difficult and they felt that Java was the cause. Java at that time had gone years without a new version and its syntax was always a challenge for programmers. After investigating other JVM languages, JetBrains made the bold decision to create their own. That language, Kotlin, debuted in 2011 and was officially released in 2016. Kotlin's concise syntax, null safety, and Java compatibility have made its popularity explode. In 2018, Google made Kotlin the preferred language for Android development, but Kotlin can do more than just build Android programs. It can replace Java anywhere, in apps and on the server, plus Kotlin can compile to JavaScript for web browsers and Node JS. And a feature still in development at the time of recording, lets Kotlin build native apps as binary executables. Hi, I'm Troy Miles, a software engineer, speaker, and author with decades of programming experience. Let me show you all you need to know to get going in Kotlin. We'll start with the basics and cover all of the essential features along the way, like classes, lambda functions, and even code routines. So, come with me and let's see how Kotlin can help you solve your programming challenges in my course, Kotlin Essential Training. Let's get coding.
